Consistent clear navigation throughout the GUI application.
Use at least two images in your application.
Include at least three labels.
Include at least three buttons.
Include at least three call-back functions for the buttons, including the exit button.
Implement secure coding best practices, including input validation to check if the user entered the correct data type, make sure the entry box is not empty, etc.
Validation testing - 20 points.  Develop an appropriate set of test data to fully validate the program against.
README.md File - 20 points.  In the project directory (which should be pushed to Github), there needs to be included a README.md file which provides a brief explanation of the project, how to get the code running and how to operate the software.
